# trytes
Converting between trytes and bytes

# What's a tryte?
Some treat 3 trits as a tryte, som etreat 5 trits as a tryte, and some treat 6 trits as a tryte.

Here we'll use the tryte3, tryte5 and tryte6 to indicate which tryte we are talking about. 
(Just as there were 7-bits and 8-bits bytes in the beginning of time.)

# How do we fit the square peg in the round hole?
We need to both put square pegs in round holes, as well as the round pegs in the square holes.

There's going to be some wasted space, no matter how we solve this.

* tryte3 can hold values 0-26
* tryte5 can hold values 0-242
* byte8 can holde values 0-255
* tryte6 can hold values 0-728
